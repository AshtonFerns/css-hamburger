# CSS Hamburger
A customisable, no JavaScript hamburger menu button.

To use, add `<input type="checkbox" id="hamburger">` to your HTML. As the button is just a stylised checkbox, you can use CSS selectors to modify elements when it is activated (checked). An example of this can be found in hamburger-example.html.
